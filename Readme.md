# üå¶Ô∏è Dashboard for Weather Data

A Django-based web application that collects, processes, and displays weather data from a public API. This project demonstrates the use of Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, and frontend technologies to create a scalable and responsive dashboard.

---

## üìù Project Description

The application fetches weather data for 5-10 major cities worldwide using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) or any other free weather API. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and is periodically updated using Celery and Redis. The project also features:

- A responsive frontend dashboard to display real-time weather data.
- A RESTful API for accessing weather data programmatically.

This project emphasizes scalability and maintainability by incorporating modern best practices, making it ready for further development and real-world applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally or in a Docker environment:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerization)
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/weather-dashboard.git
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**

   Make sure PostgreSQL is running. Create a new database and update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Add your API Key:**

   Create an `.env` file in the project directory and add your API key for OpenWeatherMap:

   ```env
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

6. **Run the application:**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Set up Celery and Redis:**

   Start Redis (if it's not already running):

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

   Run the Celery worker:

   ```bash
   celery -A project_name worker --loglevel=info
   ```

8. **(Optional) Dockerized Setup:**

   If you want to use Docker for deployment, build and run the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üí° Explanation of Design Decisions

As this was a time-constrained task (8-hour test assignment), the focus was on creating a scalable foundation rather than adding all features. Below are some key decisions:

1. **Scalability:**
   - Implemented **Docker** for containerized deployment.
   - Used **Redis** as a message broker for Celery to schedule periodic updates to weather data.
   - Designed a well-structured PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve weather data efficiently.

2. **Maintainability:**
   - Organized Django apps, models, views, and URLs according to best practices.
   - Added logging to track errors and application activity.

3. **Extensibility:**
   - Prepared the project for future features, like user authentication and advanced data visualizations.
   - Modularized the architecture to facilitate easier updates.

---

## üöÄ Deliverables

- Source code in this repository.
- Responsive web dashboard to display weather data.
- RESTful API for programmatic access to data.
- Periodic updates of weather data using Celery and Redis.

---

## üìñ Notes

- Ensure you have adequate API request limits if you're using a free-tier weather API.
- Replace placeholders in this document (e.g., `your_api_key_here`) with actual values before sharing with others.
